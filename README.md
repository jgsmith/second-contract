Second Contract Mudlib for DGD
==============================

Second Contract is a Kernel-based MUDLib running on DGD.

This MUDlib is influenced in part by the available architecture 
documentation from Skotos that has been published on the web. Additional
influences are the Dead Souls and Discworld MUDlibs.

Installing
----------

You will need a working installation of DGD and the Kernel Library that
came with the version of DGD you have installed. Once we have something
closer to a working MUBLib, we'll expand these instructions.
